# My First NLP Play - [Sentiment Analysis on Movie Reviews](https://github.com/sweta-kesur-nlp-playground/nlp-play1-movie-reviews/blob/master/Sweta-1-NLP-play-Movies.ipynb) [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/sweta-kesur-nlp-playground/NLP-playground/blob/main/Sweta_1_NLP_play_Movies.ipynb)

## Demo: https://swetakesurnlp-playground.herokuapp.com

### How it Works?

1. Enter a movie review inside the white text box as shown in the image.
2. Click `PREDICT` button to see the results of sentiment analysis of your review.
3. Check the results of your review whether it is a POSITIVE or a NEGATIVE review.

## Dataset Information

I have used 50K Movie review dataset from Kaggle. You can get it from this [link](https://www.kaggle.com/lakshmi25npathi/imdb-dataset-of-50k-movie-reviews?select=IMDB+Dataset.csv). This is a dataset for binary sentiment classification containing substantially more data than previous benchmark datasets. We provide a set of 25,000 highly polar movie reviews for training and 25,000 for testing. So, predict the number of positive and negative reviews using either classification or deep learning algorithms.
